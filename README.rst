About MPN
------------------
Most probable number (MPN) is a  way of estimating now many viable bacteria are in a sample. 
A series of dilutions are made with replication and the  number of  tubes  or wells with bacterial growth is recored.
This presence/absence and dilution information is used to calcualte the mos probable number of bacteria in a starting sample.

With liquid handling robots and plate reader thsis method can be baster than conventniona plate counting or 
spotting for some applications. 

The addition of a florescent mmarker gene into a microbe of interest can be 
used to screen for conditions that alter the growth of a specifi microbe in a complx community 
even when selective media does not work.

About MicroMPN
---------------


This python package has a command line program processing data from a plate reader. Users provide two types of files: 
A plate layout file specified in Wellmap format and a  CSV plate reader file with columns for the Plate, 
the well or row and column and the optical value used for determining growth.


Developers of Python Packages 
who need an MPN calculation may want to use MicroMPN's mpn estimation function.
This is to my knowledge the only python implmentation of MPN estimation in the Python Package Index.
This function is derived from Martine Ferguson and John Ihrie's MPN R package:

Martine Ferguson and John Ihrie. (2019). MPN: Most Probable Number and 
Other Microbial Enumeration Techniques. R package version 0.3.0. <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MPN> .

Installing
---------------

The package can be installed from the python package index 

.. code-block:: bash
  pip install micrompn



Getting Started
---------------


MicroMPN uses two types of files, a file specifing the layout of the plate and a file 
containing the data from the palte reader.

1. Wellmap TOML format <https://wellmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>  is a simple way of specifing plate layouts.
   The wellmap site has extensive doumentation about how to specify the layout. 
   
   Ane example of the format is below. Features can be specifies by rows columns or blocks:

.. code-block::

[col]
1.dilution = 1e00
2.dilution = 1e-01
3.dilution = 1e-02
4.dilution = 1e-03
5.dilution = 1e-04
6.dilution = 1e-05
7.dilution = 1e-06
8.dilution = 1e-07
9.dilution = 1e-08
10.dilution = 1e-09
11.dilution = 1e-10
12.dilution = 1e-11
[row]
A.replicate = 1
B.replicate = 2
C.replicate = 3
D.replicate = 4
E.replicate = 5
F.replicate = 6
G.replicate = 7
H.replicate = 8
[block.12x8.'A1']
sample = 1




2. Plate reader CSV files

Plate reader data files vary by instrument but most allow the output of data in tabular format.

The named columns needed in a CSV are:

 * a plate column
* a well column OR plate column AND plate row columns
*an optical value column used for the determination of growth

.. code-block::

plate_unique,plate_id,plate_well,rfu
plate_0,RFP_1_plate_1_shaking,A1,27.081
plate_0,RFP_1_plate_1_shaking,A2,22.001
plate_0,RFP_1_plate_1_shaking,A3,12.949
plate_0,RFP_1_plate_1_shaking,A4,10.328
plate_0,RFP_1_plate_1_shaking,A5,9.264
plate_0,RFP_1_plate_1_shaking,A6,10.017
plate_0,RFP_1_plate_1_shaking,A7,9.373
plate_0,RFP_1_plate_1_shaking,A8,9.049
plate_0,RFP_1_plate_1_shaking,A9,3.78


The names of these columns are specified in the command-line input microMPN.

After running microMPN the user will be provided with a CSV containing MPN estimates for each plate and sample

.. code-block::

       plate sample           mpn       mpn_adj         upper         lower
0    plate_0      0  1.005445e+08  9.220112e+07  2.295985e+08  2.295985e+08
1    plate_1      1  1.124383e+08  1.029753e+08  2.609546e+08  2.609546e+08
2    plate_2      2  3.388299e+07  2.797877e+07  6.811641e+07  6.811641e+07
3    plate_3      3  7.636579e+06  6.877494e+06  1.828966e+07  1.828966e+07
4    plate_4      4  7.515884e+05  6.752848e+05  1.195778e+06  1.195778e+06
5    plate_5      5  1.032498e+04  9.468444e+03  1.668272e+04  1.668272e+04


The output contains the MPN, an MPN value corrected for bias due to the number of 
tubes used and the concentration and an upper and lower bound on the estimate. 
MicroMPN uses the 95% confidence bound estimation form Jarvis et al. 2010
